# A one-page Netflix clone

This is a Vanilla JS project I built to practice using APIs.

I used TMDB API and all movies/images/descriptions are taken from there.

During this project I also built a carousel for the first time using JavaScript.

Update: 
I have now also added a modal that opens when a movie image is clicked on, I have also added a responsive design for mobiles (screen with a widht < 600px). 
Finally, I managed to refactor some javascript code to use only one dynamic function to render the movies after the user has clicked on a category button, instead of using a different function for each category.
