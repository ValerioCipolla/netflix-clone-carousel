# A one-page Netflix clone

This is a Vanilla JS project I built to practice using APIs.

I used TMDB API and all movies/images/descriptions are taken from there.

During this project I also built a carousel for the first time using JavaScript and as an extra feature I will also add a modal that will show every time the user clicks on a movie.
